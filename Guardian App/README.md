# Guardian app

The companion app for the people a mother nominates. It shows how she is
doing, what she may be struggling with and what they can do about it — and it
alarms them the moment she raises an SOS.

## Where it sits in the MVC architecture

The guardian app is a **third View** over the one shared Model layer. It holds
no domain logic of its own.

| Layer | Lives in | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | `../MaternalCare-Webapp/models/guardianModel.js` | Decides what a guardian may see, derives her status, and writes the "what she may be facing / how to help" insight from her own vitals and logged symptoms. |
| **Controller** | `../MaternalCare-Webapp/controllers/api/guardianApiController.js` | Thin. Resolves the link token, returns 404 for anything unknown. Routed in `../MaternalCare-Webapp/routes/api.js`. |
| **View** | this folder | React. `src/lib/api.ts` is transport only — it carries what the Model decided and never interprets it. |

The other View is `../MaternalCare-Webapp/frontend` (the mother and clinician
SPA, which `../MaternalCare-App` wraps for Android). Both read the same
models and the same PostgreSQL database, through the Webapp's API.

## Access

A guardian never logs in. The mother sends each person a private app link from
her SOS screen:

```
maternalcare://guardian/?t=<token>&api=<http://host:3000/api>
```

The token is a 24-character random string stored on that guardian's row in
`emergency_contacts`. Opening the link stores it and strips it from the
address bar. The installed Android APK can also pair by pasting the full HTTP
link or the raw code. The browser companion is available at
`http://<guardian-host>:3000/guardian-app/?t=<token>&api=<http://host:3000/api>`
after the Guardian bundle has been built. The token is a credential — anyone
holding it can read her wellbeing summary, so it is shown in the mother's app
with that warning attached.

## The server address is not compiled in

Inside the APK, `localhost` means the phone. A baked-in address would
guarantee the app could never reach the server, so the address travels in
the pairing link instead:

```
http://<guardian-host>/?t=<token>&api=<http://host:3000/api>
```

It is stored next to the token, and falls back to the host the page was
served from. One APK therefore works against a laptop on the wifi, a
college server or a real deployment with no rebuild. If a link carries an
address the phone cannot see, the app's error screen has a field to
correct it.

## Testing on a real phone

Start the mother's frontend with the machine's wifi address, so the links
it generates point somewhere the phone can actually reach:

```bash
cd frontend && VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.0.249:3000/api npm run dev
```

Substitute your own address. The backend already accepts private-network
origins in development.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5174
```

The backend must be running on port 3000. In development the API accepts
requests from `localhost:5173`, `localhost:5174` and any private-network
address on those ports, so the app can be opened on a real phone.

## Building the Android APK

Needs a JDK and the Android SDK. Android Studio ships both:

```bash
npm run apk
```

The APK lands at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and is
copied to `../MaternalCare-Webapp/public/downloads/guardian.apk`, which the mother's SOS screen
links to.

To sign a release build you will need your own keystore; the debug build is
signed with the standard debug key and is fine for sideloading.

## What each platform can actually do

This matters more than usual, because a guardian relying on an alarm that
never sounds is worse off than one who knows to keep the app open.

| | Android APK | Android PWA | iPhone (installed PWA) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard, vitals, guidance | yes | yes | yes |
| Alarm while app is open | yes | yes | yes |
| Vibration | yes | yes | **no** — Safari has never implemented the Vibration API |
| Alarm while app is closed | yes | notification only | notification only, iOS 16.4+ |
| Wakes a locked screen | yes | no | no |
| **Rings through silent / Do Not Disturb** | **yes** | no | no |

The APK earns that last row with three native pieces:

- audio played on `STREAM_ALARM` with `USAGE_ALARM`, which Android exempts
  from the ringer switch and from Do Not Disturb
- a notification channel with `setBypassDnd(true)` and a **full-screen
  intent**, which wakes the device and shows `AlarmActivity` over the keyguard
- a foreground service (`SosWatchService`) polling every 20 seconds, because
  without Firebase there is no push channel and Android will not let a
  background app poll reliably

On iPhone none of that is possible from the web. Overriding the ringer needs
Apple's *critical alert* entitlement, which is only granted to a native
app on request. The app therefore leans on what iOS does allow — a
full-volume alarm while open, a full-screen flashing alert, and a screen wake
lock — and the capability panel on the dashboard says plainly which of those
this particular phone will do.

### iOS build

`npx cap add ios` generates an Xcode project, but compiling an `.ipa`
requires macOS with Xcode. It cannot be produced on Windows. Until then
iPhone guardians use the installable PWA: open the link in Safari, then
**Share → Add to Home Screen**.
