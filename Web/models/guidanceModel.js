/**
 * Guidance Model — the personalised nutrition, movement and lifestyle plan.
 *
 * What this replaces
 * ------------------
 * There were two things standing in for this feature, and both were fiction.
 *
 * `riskModel` carried three hardcoded arrays of four tips, keyed only by risk
 * level, so every mother at "medium" read the same four sentences whether she
 * was in week 9 or week 39, whether her score came from blood pressure or from
 * blood sugar, and whether or not she had gestational diabetes on her record.
 *
 * The mother's dashboard carried a "Nutrition today — % of daily goal" panel
 * reading Folate 92%, Iron 78%, Calcium 85%. The app has never had any food
 * logging of any kind. Those numbers could not have been measured, and a bar
 * chart is a claim of measurement; a mother reading "Iron 78%" would believe
 * something about her own body that nothing in this system knows.
 *
 * What this is
 * ------------
 * A deterministic rule engine, not a language model. Every line it emits is
 * traceable to a rule and to the reading that fired it, which is why each item
 * carries a `why` naming that reading. That is the difference between advice
 * and personalised advice, and it is the part a mother — or an examiner — can
 * actually check.
 *
 * The numeric targets follow published maternal guidance (WHO antenatal care
 * recommendations, the IOM gestational weight gain ranges the pregnancy model
 * already uses, and the widely published RNI/RDA figures for pregnancy). They
 * are stated as targets, never as intake, because intake is not something this
 * app can see.
 *
 * Safety
 * ------
 * The engine will not prescribe exercise to a high-risk profile. Activity is
 * the one domain here where following generic advice can do direct harm, so
 * above the medium band it hands the decision to her obstetrician and offers
 * only what is safe under any circumstance.
