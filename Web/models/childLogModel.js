/**
 * Child Log Model — the daily check-in for a baby or young child.
 *
 * Mirrors `dailyLogModel`, which asks a woman about herself. That set of
 * questions — mood, kicks, water, sleep — is right while she is pregnant and
 * wrong the day after. A mother of a four-month-old is not counting kicks; she
 * is counting feeds and wet nappies, and those are the first numbers a
 * paediatrician asks for when something is wrong.
 *
 * Same partial-update rule as the mother's log: sending one field must not
 * blank the others, because the check-in is answered in pieces across a day
 * that a parent does not control.

 * Only rules that are genuinely actionable and genuinely age-independent. The

 * whether a baby is getting enough milk, before any weight is lost. The fever
 * threshold is the age-sensitive one, and it is the reason `ageMonths` is
 * passed in at all: a temperature that warrants a call at three weeks is
 * different from the same reading at three years.
