/**
 * Doctor Model — the clinicians a mother can request an appointment with,
 * and the ranking that decides who to recommend first.
 *
 * The ranking answers one question: of the doctors who could actually see her
 * soon, who is best qualified for what she needs? Qualification alone would
 * send everybody to the busiest consultant; availability alone would send them
 * to whoever happens to be idle. Both are scored, then added.
 *
 * There is deliberately nothing here for her to filter by. Every input the
 * list could be filtered on — what they specialise in, how they are rated,
 * whether they have room, how fast they answer — is already read, weighted
 * and ordered below. Handing a woman four dropdowns asks her to guess at
 * weightings the server can work out from the data it holds, and the guess
 * she is least equipped to make is the one that matters most: how much
 * "FCPS" should count against "free on Thursday". So she gets a list, in
 * order, each entry saying in words why it sits where it does.
