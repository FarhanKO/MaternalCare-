/**
 * Moderation Model — reporting content, and acting on what gets reported.
 *
 * The board carried the line "Posts are moderated · clinician-reviewed" from
 * the day it was written, and nothing behind it was true: no report button, no
 * queue, no way to take anything down. That is a worse failure here than on a
 * general forum. The thing this exists to catch is a confident stranger
 * telling a pregnant woman that her prescription is unnecessary, and a mother
 * who believes the board is watched is more likely to act on what she reads.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating:
 *
 * Clinicians moderate. The proposal puts reported content under an
 * administrator, and that portal does not exist yet — but the people best
 * placed to judge whether antenatal advice is dangerous are already in this
 * app with accounts, and leaving reports unread until an admin portal is built
 * would mean shipping the button without the promise behind it.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted. Upholding a report sets `hidden_at`. A removal that
 * destroys the evidence cannot be reviewed, appealed or explained to the
 * person who wrote it, and a comment that simply vanishes leaves a thread
 * that no longer reads as a conversation.
