/**
 * ML Risk Model — the Node side of the FastAPI classifier.
 *
 * The application does not depend on this service being up, and that is the
 * central design decision rather than a nicety. A maternal health app that
 * shows nothing when a Python process is not running is worse than one with no
 * model at all, so every call here is short, guarded, and returns null instead
 * of throwing. `riskModel` — the transparent rule engine — remains the thing
 * the rest of the app is built on.
 *
 * Why keep both rather than replace one with the other:
 *
 *   * The rule engine explains itself. It returns the individual factors that
 *     produced the score, and the care plan (guidanceModel) is built entirely
 *     out of those factors — "your last fasting glucose was 104 mg/dL" comes
 *     from there. A classifier returns a class and a probability and has
 *     nothing to say about why.
 *
 *   * The model has seen real pregnancies. Its thresholds were learned from
 *     451 distinct records from Bangladeshi clinics rather than written into a
 *     JavaScript file by hand.
 *
 * They are therefore reported side by side, and where they disagree that is
 * shown rather than resolved. A disagreement is information: it means the
 * reading sits somewhere the two ways of looking at it part company, which is
 * exactly when a clinician should be the one deciding.
