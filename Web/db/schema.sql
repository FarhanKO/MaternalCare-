-- MaternalCare+ — PostgreSQL schema
--
-- Ported from the SQLite schema this project grew up on. Three things change
-- deliberately rather than being copied across:
--
--   * real types. SQLite kept every date and flag as TEXT/INTEGER; Postgres
--     gets DATE, TIMESTAMPTZ and BOOLEAN. The API contract is unchanged —
--     config/database.js registers type parsers that hand dates back as the
--     same 'YYYY-MM-DD' and ISO strings the clients already parse.
--
--   * foreign keys, which SQLite declared but never enforced without
--     PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON. Orphan rows were possible; now they are not.
--
--   * CHECK constraints on the small set of enum-ish columns, so a typo in a
--     status or a kind fails at the database rather than silently creating a
--     row no query will ever match.
--
-- Run with:  npm run db:reset
