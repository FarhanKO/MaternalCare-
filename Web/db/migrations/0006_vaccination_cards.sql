-- Cards could always be uploaded, but only into the general document store —
-- so a photograph of an immunisation card sat beside prescriptions and scan
-- results with nothing saying which dose it proved. A clinician checking
-- whether the 14-week pentavalent had actually been given had to read every
-- document to find out.
--
-- Nullable, because most documents are not vaccination cards and never will
-- be. ON DELETE SET NULL rather than CASCADE: if a vaccination row is ever
-- removed the card is still the patient's own record and must survive.
