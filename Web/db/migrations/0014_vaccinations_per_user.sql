-- Vaccination schedules belong to somebody.
--
-- The table had no owner column at all: one global list of doses that every
-- account read and wrote. With a single seeded mother that is invisible, and
-- it is why it survived — but it means F7's "personalized vaccination
-- scheduler" was not personalised, and marking a dose done marked it done for
-- every user of the platform at once.
--
-- Backfilled to the first mother, who is the only account that has been
-- marking them; a fresh database seeds them per user.
