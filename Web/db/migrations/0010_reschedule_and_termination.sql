-- Rescheduling, cancelling with a reason, and ending the care relationship.
--
-- Three gaps, and they are different sizes.
--
-- Rescheduling did not exist at all. A mother whose Tuesday no longer worked
-- had one move available to her: cancel, and go back to the end of the queue
-- behind everyone who had not had to change anything.
--
-- Cancelling existed but recorded nothing. `status = 'cancelled'` and no
-- reason, no author, no time. The clinician saw a slot go empty and never
-- learned why, which is the difference between "she found the cost too high"
-- and "she went into labour".
--
-- Ending the relationship did not exist either. A mother could stop booking
-- and a doctor could stop accepting, but neither could say so, and each stayed
-- on the other's list indefinitely. That is the one that needed a reason most:
-- a clinician who is being left because their replies take three days should
-- be told that, and a mother being let go deserves to know it was capacity and
-- not something she did.
