 * Gives every seeded account a password.

 *   npm run db:passwords
 *
 * Run after db:seed and db:stages. Idempotent — re-running simply re-hashes.
 *
 * The passwords are printed here because they are demo credentials for a
 * database full of invented people, and somebody has to be able to sign in to
 * look at the work. They are deliberately obvious rather than plausible, so
 * nobody is tempted to reuse one, and they exist nowhere in the application
 * itself: the only stored form is a scrypt hash.
 *
 * If this project is ever pointed at a real person's data, every one of these
 * accounts has to go. That is not a style note — a known password on a
 * medical record is the whole problem.
