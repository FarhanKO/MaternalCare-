    hook: 'It peaks around week 9 and is the one symptom that reliably improves on its own.',
    why: 'Nausea tracks the hormone hCG, which rises steeply in the first weeks and then falls away — which is why most people turn a corner somewhere between weeks 12 and 16. It is unpleasant rather than dangerous, and it is not a sign anything is wrong. What matters is keeping fluids down.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Eat before you get up', detail: 'Keep dry crackers by the bed. An empty stomach makes it worse, and the dip is deepest overnight.' },
      { label: 'Small and often beats three meals', detail: 'Something every two hours, even a few bites, keeps blood sugar from swinging.' },

    weeks: [8, 16], timing: 'Offered at 11–14 weeks',
    hook: 'It is the measurement that fixes your due date — and every date after it is counted from this one.',
    why: 'Cycle length varies, so the date worked out from your last period can be off by a week or more. The scan measures the baby crown to rump, which is remarkably consistent between pregnancies at this stage, and the due date is reset to that. It also confirms how many babies there are and where the placenta has settled.',
    steps: [

    why: 'Advice used to be "ten kicks a day", and it was dropped because it is not what the evidence supports. Babies establish an individual rhythm by around 24 to 28 weeks. A reduction in that rhythm can be the earliest sign the placenta is not working as well as it should, which is why it is the one thing worth calling about the same day.',

    why: 'Lying flat on your back lets the weight of the uterus press on the vena cava, the large vein returning blood to your heart. That reduces blood flow to the placenta. Large studies link going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks with a higher stillbirth risk — and it is one of the few risks you can change for free, tonight.',
    steps: [

    hook: 'Your baby stockpiles enough iron in the final weeks to last their first six months of life.',
    why: 'Blood volume rises by almost half during pregnancy, so the same iron is spread thinner. At the same time your baby is drawing iron across the placenta to build their own stores. Low iron is easy to miss because the symptoms — tiredness, breathlessness, feeling cold — look like ordinary pregnancy.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Pair iron with vitamin C', detail: 'Orange juice, tomato, or peppers alongside the tablet can multiply absorption several times over.' },

    hook: 'It is offered between 24 and 28 weeks, and a raised result is common, manageable and not your fault.',
    why: 'Pregnancy hormones make your body less responsive to insulin so more sugar reaches the baby. For most people the pancreas compensates. When it cannot, blood sugar rises — gestational diabetes. Untreated it can grow the baby larger than is safe for birth, so it is screened for routinely.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Follow the fasting instructions', detail: 'If your clinic asks you to fast, do it — eating skews the result and you may need to repeat it.' },

    hook: 'Feeding should feel like tugging, not pinching. Pain is information, not something to push through.',
    why: 'A shallow latch means baby is drawing on the nipple rather than the breast tissue behind it. That hurts you and empties the breast poorly, which lowers supply. A deep latch fixes both at once.',
