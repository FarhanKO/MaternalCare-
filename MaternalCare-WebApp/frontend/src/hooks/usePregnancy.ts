/**
 * Where she is in the pregnancy, from her record.
 *
 * The dashboard used to hardcode `week={26}` in five places while the model
 * was deriving 29 from her LMP, so the whole "this week" story — the arc, the
 * progress ring, the baby's size, the reading list — was frozen on a week she
 * had already passed. Everything that mentions a week now reads this.
 *
 * `null` means either no pregnancy on the account or an unreachable API; the
 * caller shows nothing week-specific rather than inventing a number.
