/**
 * Care Ending Model — ending the relationship between a mother and a
 * clinician, from either side, with a reason.
 *
 * This is not cancelling an appointment. An appointment is one visit; this is
 * the arrangement the visits sit inside — the clinician on her care team, the
 * month of messaging she paid for, the person her SOS reaches. Until now there
 * was no way to end it and no way to say why. A mother stopped booking, a
 * clinician stopped accepting, and each stayed on the other's list forever
 * with nothing recorded.
 *
 * Why the reason matters more here than anywhere else in this app:
 *
 *  - a clinician being left because their replies take three days cannot fix
 *    that unless somebody tells them, and nobody tells a doctor that to their
 *    face;
 *  - a mother being let go needs to know whether it was capacity or something
 *    she did, because she will assume the worse of the two;
 *  - and a woman leaving because she cannot afford it is a different problem
 *    for the service than one leaving because she has given birth.
 *
 * So the category is required and comes from a fixed list per side — free text
 * alone cannot be counted — while the written note is optional, because
 * requiring an essay to leave is a way of making people not leave.
 *
 * Ending is reversible by starting again: booking with the same clinician
 * resumes the pairing and stamps `resumed_at`. The record of the ending
 * survives that, because it is a fact about what happened.
