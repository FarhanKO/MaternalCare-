/**
 * Per-request context.
 *
 * `userModel.current()` is called from deep inside the model layer — the care
 * plan, the risk assessment, the report builder — none of which take a user
 * id, because for the whole life of this project there was only ever one user.
 * Real sessions break that assumption: the answer now depends on who is
 * asking, and the answer has to reach code that was never given a way to ask.
 *
 * The alternatives were threading a userId through every model signature —
 * dozens of functions, and one missed call silently serving the wrong woman's
 * record — or this: Node's own AsyncLocalStorage, which carries a value down
 * an async call tree without touching anything in between.
 *
 * The important property is that it is *per request*. A module-level variable
 * would look identical in a single-user demo and would serve one patient's
 * data to another the moment two requests overlapped.
