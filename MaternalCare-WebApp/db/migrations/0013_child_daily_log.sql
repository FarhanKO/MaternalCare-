-- What a parent notices about their child, day by day.
--
-- The daily check-in has only ever asked a woman about herself: mood, kicks,
-- water, sleep. That is the right set of questions while she is pregnant and
-- the wrong one afterwards — a mother of a four-month-old is not counting
-- kicks, she is counting feeds and wet nappies, and those are the numbers a
-- paediatrician asks for first when something is wrong.
--
-- One row per child per day, same shape as daily_logs, so the two can be
-- charted side by side and answered in one sitting.
--
-- Deliberately few fields. Every one of these is something a parent already
-- knows without measuring: how many times the baby fed, how many wet nappies,
-- roughly how long they slept, and how they seemed. Temperature is here
-- because it is the one number that turns a quiet worry into a phone call,
-- and it is the only one that needs a thermometer.
