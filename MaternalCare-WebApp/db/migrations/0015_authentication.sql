-- Real accounts, replacing "the first mother by id".
--
-- Until now `userModel.current()` ran `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role='mother'
-- ORDER BY id LIMIT 1`. Every request was that woman, the clinician portal was
-- reachable by anyone who typed /doctor, and GET /api/patients/2 handed a
-- patient record to whoever asked. That is fine for a demo and disqualifying
-- for anything else, and it was the first item on the production checklist.
--
-- Passwords are scrypt, which ships with Node and needs no native dependency.
-- Parameters are OWASP's recommended minimum (N=2^17, r=8, p=1), which costs
-- about 200 ms per verification on this machine — slow enough to make a stolen
-- table expensive to attack, fast enough that nobody notices signing in.
--
-- The stored format is self-describing:
--     scrypt$N$r$p$<salt base64>$<hash base64>
-- so the cost can be raised later without stranding the accounts hashed at the
-- old parameters. Nothing here ever stores or logs a password.
