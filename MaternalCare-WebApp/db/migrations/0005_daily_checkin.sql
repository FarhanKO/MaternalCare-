-- The two metrics the daily check-in asks for that had nowhere to go.
--
-- The mother's dashboard drew four trend charts. Two of them — blood pressure
-- and weight — came from the vitals table and were real. The other two, sleep
-- and fetal heart rate, were hardcoded arrays flying a "sample" tag, because
-- no column existed behind them. These are those columns.
--
-- sleep_hours joins mood, kicks and water on daily_logs: it is something she
-- reports once for a whole day, upserted on the same (user_id, date) row.
--
-- fetal_bpm joins the clinical measurements on vitals: it is a reading taken
-- at a moment, so several in one day are legitimate and each gets a row.
