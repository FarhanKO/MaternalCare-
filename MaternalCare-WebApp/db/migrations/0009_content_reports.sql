-- Reporting and moderation for the community board.
--
-- The board has told mothers "Posts are moderated" and "moderated and
-- clinician-reviewed" since it was written. Nothing moderated anything: there
-- was no way to report a post, no queue, and no way to remove one. On a
-- maternal health forum that is not a cosmetic gap — the specific harm this
-- feature exists to catch is a confident stranger telling a pregnant woman to
-- stop taking something.
--
-- `hidden_at` rather than DELETE, on both posts and comments. A removal that
-- destroys the evidence cannot be reviewed, appealed or explained, and a
-- comment that vanishes leaves a thread that no longer makes sense.
