-- Doctors register themselves, so the doctors table has to hold what a
-- registering clinician gives us: how to reach them, and the licence that
-- lets them practise. Until now every row arrived from the seed file, so
-- there was nowhere to put any of it.
--
-- The unique indexes are partial because the seeded roster predates
-- registration and has no licence or work address to be unique about.
