"""
Maternal health risk prediction service.

    uvicorn app:app --port 8000

A small FastAPI service in front of the model trained by train.py. The Node
application calls POST /predict and merges the answer with its own rule engine;
it never depends on this being up.

The service does three jobs that are not "run the model":

1. It converts units. The application speaks mg/dL and Celsius because that is
   what a Bangladeshi clinic writes on a chart; the model learned mmol/L and
   Fahrenheit because that is how the dataset was published. Getting this wrong
   throws no error — it returns a confident answer computed from a glucose
   value eighteen times too large.

2. It refuses input it should not be predicting from. A model asked about a
   systolic pressure of 400 will still return a class and a probability. Out of
   range means 422, not a guess.

3. It says how sure it is, and how good it is. Every prediction carries the
   class probabilities and a pointer to the training metrics, because a model
   trained on 451 distinct records should not be presented as an oracle.

    Bring a reading inside the range the model was trained on — or refuse.

    The two directions are not symmetrical, and treating them the same way was
    the first thing that had to be fixed here.

    Below the minimum, the reading is *better* than anything the model saw. The
    UCI dataset's lowest blood glucose is 6 mmol/L, or 108 mg/dL, which is
    already above a normal fasting result: the data contains no healthy-glucose
    pregnancies at all. Rejecting those left the service unable to say anything
    about most of the mothers using this app. Clamping to the minimum asks the
    model its most favourable seen value, which can only understate risk in the
    direction of "she is fine", and the response says the value was clamped.

    Above the maximum it is refused. Clamping a glucose of 400 mg/dL down to
    342 would hide exactly the severity that matters, and at that end the
    honest answer is not a class from a small model — it is the rule engine and
    the vital-sign alerts, which both already say see someone now.
