"""
Train the maternal health risk classifier.

    python train/train.py

Reads data/maternal-health-risk.csv (UCI Maternal Health Risk Data Set, 1,014
records collected from hospitals and community clinics in rural Bangladesh),
trains a model, writes model.joblib and metrics.json in the service directory.

Two things about this dataset that matter more than the choice of algorithm:

Units. `BS` is millimoles per litre and `BodyTemp` is Fahrenheit. The
application stores blood glucose in mg/dL and temperature in Celsius, because
that is what Bangladeshi clinics write on a chart. Feeding 104 mg/dL into a
model that learned "6 to 19" would not throw an error — it would quietly
predict from a value four hundred times too large, and return a confident
answer. The conversion happens in app.py at the API boundary and is tested,
because a silent unit error is the most likely way this whole service ends up
worse than the rule engine it sits beside.

Size. One thousand rows is a small dataset, and it comes from one country's
clinics. That is enough to be useful and nowhere near enough to be authoritative,
which is why the service returns its confidence and its training metrics
alongside every prediction, and why the application keeps the transparent rule
engine as an equal voice rather than deferring to this.
