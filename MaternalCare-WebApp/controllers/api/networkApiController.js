/**
 * Network API Controller — where this server can be reached from.
 *
 * The guardian pairing link carries the API address, because inside the
 * installed APK "localhost" is the phone rather than the laptop. But the
 * mother builds that link in a browser that only knows the origin *it* used,
 * which on the development machine is http://localhost:3000 — an address no
 * other device can reach. Every guardian therefore got a link that could not
 * work until they typed the right address in by hand.
 *
 * Only the server knows its own LAN addresses, so it answers with them. No
 * domain data is involved, which is why this reads an OS interface list
 * directly rather than going through a model.
